TO DO FOR APPLESCRIPT "CREATEXML"
=================================

	=> Research: how to create loop based on decision at end of script instead of count
	(to be used for authors, and for optional information)
		->solution: use try block (as used for decision to move to next folder) within repeat
		
- add functionality for different sections
	=> add xml-tags for sections
	=> prompt for pdf's that are not articles (by section)
	=> create xml's for these separately
	=> write section as annotation to files
	=> do loop for remaining pdf's without annotation
	
- add functionality for generating and including url's

- further refinements
	=> create loops for adding authors (with option for no author included)
	=> ask for many more types of content with option to keep it empty
	=> make switching between applescript and skim more convenient
