TO DO FOR APPLESCRIPT "CREATEXML"
=================================

- add writing to log-file to keep track of progress
	=> log is list of folder_names
	=> my_folder is set by taking the folder with index +1 of index of last folder_name on log
	=> initial prompt for choosing folder is then set to parent-folder of issue
	=> script ends with writing to log
	=> Research: how to create loop based on decision at end of script instead of count
	
- add functionality for different sections
	=> add xml-tags for sections
	=> prompt for pdf's that are not articles (by section)
	=> create xml's for these separately
	=> write section as annotation to files
	=> do loop for remaining pdf's without annotation
	
- add functionality for generating and including url's
