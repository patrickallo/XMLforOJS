TO DO FOR APPLESCRIPT "CREATEXML"
=================================

- xml-format still not perfect
- find way of dealing with - for surnames
	
- add functionality for generating and including url's
See: http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php/Importing_and_Exporting_Data#Articles_and_Issues_XML_Plugin

- further refinements
	=> ask for many more types of content with option to keep it empty
	=> make switching between applescript and skim more convenient
